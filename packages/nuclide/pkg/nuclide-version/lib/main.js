/*
 * This is the versioning of Nuclide client-server protocol.
 * It is not a communication protocol per se. It is the sum of communication and
 * services API.
 *
 * First, no commit shall break the protocol in that client and server
 * from the same master shall always work with each other.
 * That means, no client new feature shall be enabled before the dependent
 * server serice is in place, while it is OK to add a new server service before
 * the client is ready.
 *
 * Rule number two. Every commit that breaks the backward compatibility shall
 * bump the version in package.json. This includes any client changes
 * (new feature or whatever) that do not work with the older servers.
 * It also includes server changes that break older clients.
