#!/bin/bash
#
# This is a script that is designed to open files in an editor as quickly as
# possible, preferring the use of Atom, but falling back to another editor if
# Atom is not already running. Specifically, because Atom can be slow to load or
# open a new window, it only uses Atom if the Atom Command Service provided by
# [Nuclide](https://atom.io/packages/nuclide) is running.
#
# This script takes a list of files to open (each file argument may contain its
# own `:line:column` suffix at the end of it if the editor supports it), as well
# as an optional -w/--wait flag that is only passed on to the Atom Command
# Service (other editors can check if the $ATOM_WAIT environment variable is set
# to determine whether it was specified). This tries the following options,
# in order, for opening the specified files:
#
# 1. Attempts Nuclide's Atom Command Service to open the file in a new tab in an
#    existing Atom window.
# 2. If $ATOM_BACKUP_EDITOR is set, then it is used to open the files.
# 3. If $EDITOR is set, then it is used to open the files.
# 4. If none of the above is an option, `vi` is used to open the files.
#
# Note that this script is designed to work locally or remotely. That is, it
# tries the Atom Command Script first so that the user's local Atom is the first
# choice even if this script is run from a remote machine using the Nuclide
# server via the `nuclide` NPM module. If that fails, then a local editor is
# used.

# Try the Atom Command Service with the specified args.
